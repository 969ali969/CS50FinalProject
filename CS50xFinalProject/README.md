#CS50 Final Project
#### Video Demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-R4EanvoJ8>
#### Description:
Hello, my name is Ali Shafiei and this is my final project,
so its a website that offers you some full traveling packages.
its built on HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
I also got some help frmo bootstarp for my login and registration forms,
theres is a section of my website that called Travelers Gallery for this part of website
I used lightbox CSS and JavaScript.
I have a full map on my website that i used TomTom Developer Portal for
with their free API key (thanks to them).
I used the section for most of my work in home.html and it has
6 section first is header of the webpage, the second one is for
recommended destinations, the third is the gallery of travelers,
the fourth is for booking our travel packages that i used bootstrap for,
the fifth is for users review the last is the footer of the webpage
that contains some information about us.
I have 4 CSS file the main one is style.css that is same for all
templates i had to make diffrent css files cause i didnt need
some of the for some templates, and the lightbox.css is the help
that i got for my travlers gallery.
and in the last the lightbox-plus-jquery.js that is the javascript
that keeps the travlers gallery up.
I also did all i could to make my website to be rendered as it should
in all templates but there was some bug that i didnt know how to fix
even do i tried so hard :(
And the img folder contains all the pictures that i used for the  website
that i found on the internt.
I tried to have the home button for all templates but i couldnt do
it for the explore page.
And in book.html is the template that basically shows all the offers
that are available at the moment.
All the templates like CA, IT, LA, TU are templates that i used
for my travlers gallery that each one of them contain 6 pictures
for the specific destination.
And one thing that you will find out about the website is
that there isnt a good backend for website like you cant login or register
thats because im in a team that we make website for others and sell it to them thanks to cs50 :)
im a frontend developer, when i asked them to do the backend for me
they said that they are buys and thay cant do it.
and i didnt try to do it my self becuase im working on frontend as of now
and i thought it is better to improve my knowledge for frontend.
so its a frontend work that i presented it as i mentioned it in the video.
--THIS WAS MY FINAL PROJECT--
--In The End I Have To Realy Appreciate All Of The Providers For CS50 Course Especially The CS50xharvard--
